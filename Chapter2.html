                A <b>software process</b> is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product.
                These activities may involve developing software from scratch in languages like Java or C.
                However, modern business applications often extend existing systems or integrate off-the-shelf software components.

            <article class="main-p1 text-justify">
                <p><br>The first published model of the software development process was derived from more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process activities before starting work on them.</p><br>
                <p><b>Principal Stages of the Waterfall Model Reflect the Fundamental Development Activities:</b></p><br>

                <ol class="main-ol2">
                    <li><b>Requirements analysis and definition:</b> The system’s services, constraints, and goals are established by consultation with users and documented in detail.</li>
                    <li><b>System and software design:</b> Requirements are allocated to system components, defining architecture and software abstractions.</li>
                    <li><b>Implementation and unit testing:</b> The design is realized through coding, and each unit is tested to meet specifications.</li>
                    <li><b>Integration and system testing:</b> Components are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure requirements are met.</li>
                    <li><b>Operation and maintenance:</b> The system is deployed and maintained; errors are corrected, and enhancements are made as new requirements arise.</li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each phase produces documentation that is reviewed and approved before the next phase begins. However, in practice, feedback loops occur — issues in design may lead to revisiting requirements, and testing can reveal design flaws. This iterative reality makes the process more dynamic than a simple linear flow.</p><br>
                    <p>The waterfall model is consistent with engineering discipline — structured, document-driven, and predictable. Its downside lies in inflexibility; adapting to changing requirements can be costly once stages are locked.</p><br>
                    <p>This model works best when requirements are stable and well understood from the start. It’s still widely used because it aligns with standard project management practices and offers visibility through documentation.</p><br>
                    <p>Variants like <b>formal system development</b> introduce mathematical precision to improve safety and reliability, making it suitable for mission-critical or security-critical systems.</p>

                    <li><b>Process visibility:</b> Without formal deliverables for each version, tracking progress can be difficult.</li>
                    <li><b>Architectural degradation:</b> As increments accumulate, system structure may degrade unless time is devoted to refactoring.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>These challenges are most acute in large, complex systems involving multiple teams.Incremental development can also combine with staged deployment, where real user interaction provides valuable feedback.</p>

                <p>Real software processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative, and managerial activities with the overall goal of specifying, designing, implementing, and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for supporting the editing of different types of document and for managing the immense volume of detailed information that is generated in a large software project.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are organized differently in different development processes. In the waterfall model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are interleaved. How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software, people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example, specifications are written on cards. Tests are executable and developed before the program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.</p>

            <article class="main-p1 text-white-700">
                <p>Change is inevitable in all large software projects. The system requirements change as the business procuring the system responds to external pressures and management priorities change. As new technologies become available, new design and implementation possibilities emerge. Therefore, whatever software process model is used, it is essential that it can accommodate changes to the software being developed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Change adds to the costs of software development because it usually means that work that has been completed has to be redone. This is called <b>rework</b>. For example, if the relationships between the requirements in a system have been analyzed and new requirements are then identified, some or all of the requirements analysis has to be repeated. It may then be necessary to redesign the system to deliver the new requirements, change any programs that have been developed, and re-test the system.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p-class2">There are two related approaches that may be used to reduce the costs of rework:</p>

            <article class="main-p1 text-white-700">
                <ol class="ol-li"><br>
                    <li><b>Change avoidance:</b> Where the software process includes activities that can anticipate possible changes before significant rework is required. For example, a prototype system may be developed to show some key features of the system to customers. They can experiment with the prototype and refine their requirements before committing to high software production costs.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Change tolerance:</b> Where the process is designed so that changes can be accommodated at relatively low cost. This normally involves some form of incremental development. Proposed changes may be implemented in increments that have not yet been developed. If this is impossible, then only a single increment (a small part of the system) may have to be altered to incorporate the change.

                    The notion of <b>refactoring</b>, namely improving the structure and organization of a program, is also an important mechanism that supports change tolerance. This topic is explored further in Chapter 3, which covers agile methods.

            <p><b>Incremental delivery</b> (Figure 2.10) is an approach to software development where some of the developed increments are delivered to the customer and deployed for use in an operational environment. In this process, customers identify in outline the services to be provided by the system, prioritizing which services are most important. Several delivery increments are then defined, each providing a subset of system functionality. The highest-priority services are implemented and delivered first.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once the system increments have been identified, the requirements for the services to be delivered in the first increment are defined in detail and that increment is developed. During development, further requirements analysis for later increments can take place, but requirements changes for the current increment are not accepted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once an increment is completed and delivered, customers can put it into service, allowing early delivery of part of the system functionality. This helps customers clarify their requirements for later increments. As new increments are completed, they are integrated with existing ones so that the system functionality improves with each delivery.</p>

            <p>To gain some benefits of incremental development in these cases, teams may iteratively develop a <b>prototype</b> to experiment with system requirements and design. The insights gained then guide the creation of definitive system requirements.</p>

            <p>A <b>risk-driven software process framework</b>, the Spiral Model, was proposed by Barry Boehm (1988). Illustrated in Figure 2.11, it represents the software process as a spiral rather than a simple sequence of activities. Each loop in the spiral corresponds to a phase — such as feasibility, requirements, design, or development — integrating change avoidance with change tolerance. It assumes that changes stem from project risks and explicitly includes risk management to minimize them.</p>

            <p>The Spiral Model’s major distinction from other models is its <b>explicit recognition of risk</b>. Each cycle starts by defining objectives and constraints, then exploring alternatives to mitigate risks. These risks are resolved through information-gathering, prototyping, or simulation before moving to development.</p>
            <p>Once risks are assessed, the project proceeds with development followed by planning for the next iteration. Here, “risk” simply refers to anything that can go wrong — such as unreliable compilers, inefficient object code, or poor integration. Risk management, essential to project success, reduces potential schedule delays and cost overruns. This is explored further in <b>Chapter 22</b>.</p>

        <article class="main-p1">
            <p>The Rational Unified Process (RUP) (Krutchen, 2003) is an example of a modern process model that has been derived from work on the UML and the associated Unified Software Development Process (Rumbaugh, et al., 1999; Arlow and Neustadt, 2005). It is a good example of a hybrid process model that brings together elements from all the generic process models, illustrates good practice in specification and design, and supports prototyping and incremental delivery.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>The RUP recognizes that conventional process models present a single view of the process. In contrast, the RUP is described from three perspectives:</b></p>

                <li>A static perspective, which shows the process activities that are enacted.</li>
                <li>A practice perspective, which suggests good practices to be used during the process.</li>
            </ol>
        </article>

        <article class="main-p1">
            <p>Most descriptions of the RUP attempt to combine the static and dynamic perspectives in a single diagram (Krutchen, 2003). This makes the process harder to understand, so separate descriptions of each perspective are often clearer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The RUP is a phased model that identifies four discrete phases in the software process. However, unlike the waterfall model where phases are equated with process activities, the RUP phases are more closely related to business rather than technical concerns. <b>These are:</b></p>

                <li><b>Inception:</b> The goal of the inception phase is to establish a business case for the system.

                <li><b>Elaboration:</b> The goals of the elaboration phase are to develop an understanding of the problem domain, establish an architectural framework, develop the project plan, and identify key project risks.</li>
                
                <li><b>Construction:</b> The construction phase involves system design, programming, and testing. Parts of the system are developed in parallel and integrated during this phase.</li>

            <p>Iteration within the RUP is supported in two ways: each phase may be enacted iteratively with results developed incrementally, and the entire set of phases may also be enacted incrementally, as shown by the looping arrow from Transition to Inception in Figure 2.12.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The static view of the RUP focuses on the activities (workflows) that take place during development. There are six core process workflows and three supporting workflows. The RUP is designed alongside UML, so its workflow descriptions are oriented around UML models such as sequence and object models.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The advantage of presenting dynamic and static views is that RUP workflows are not tied to specific phases — in principle, all workflows may be active at all stages. Early phases emphasize business modelling and requirements, while later phases focus on testing and deployment.</p>

            <p>The RUP is not suitable for all development types (e.g., embedded systems), but it effectively combines elements from the three generic process models. Its key innovations include separating phases from workflows and recognizing deployment as an essential part of the process.
