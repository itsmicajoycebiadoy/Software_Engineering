                  <p class="s-paragraph mt-10">     Businesses today face a fast-changing, global environment that demands rapid software
                     development to seize opportunities and stay competitive. <br>
                     Because requirements often change unpredictably, traditional plan-driven models like the waterfall approach are 
                     too rigid, leading to delays and <br>outdated systems. While such models may still suit 
                     safety-critical systems, business software needs flexible, rapid development processes 
                     that <br>adapt to evolving requirements.<br> <br>
                     This need led to incremental development in the 1980s
                     and gained momentum in the late 1990s with the rise of agile methodologies such as <br>DSDM, 
                     Scrum, and Extreme Programming.<br><br>

                     Rapid software development processes are designed to produce useful software quickly.
                    The software is not developed as a single unit but as a <br>series of increments,with each
                    increment including new system functionality. Although there are many approaches to rapid
                    software development, <br>they share some fundamental characteristics:<br><br></p>

                    
                <ol>
                    <li class="s-paragraph"> The processes of specification, design, and implementation are interleaved.
                         There is no detailed system specification, and design documentation <br>is mini
                         mized or generated automatically by the programming environment used to
                         implement the system. The user requirements document only<br> defines the most
                         important characteristics of the system.<br><br></li>
                    <li class="s-paragraph"> The system is developed in a series of versions. End-users and other system
                        stakeholders are involved in specifying and evaluating each version. <br>They may
                        propose changes to the software and new requirements that should be imple
                        mented in a later version of the system.<br><br></li>
                    <li class="s-paragraph">System user interfaces are often developed using an interactive development
                        system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by<br> drawing and placing
                        icons on the interface. The system may then generate a web-based interface for 
                        a browser or an interface for a specific <br>platform such as Microsoft Windows.<br><br></li>
                </ol>

                <p id="3.1" class="s-paragraph"> Agile methods are incremental development methods in which the increments are
                    small and, typically, new releases of the system are created <br>and made available to cus
                    tomers every two or three weeks. They involve customers in the development process
                    to get rapid feedback on <br>changing requirements. They minimize documentation by
                    using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents.<br><br></p>

            <div class="threewan-box ">
                <h2  class="title ">3.1 AGILE METHODS</h2>
                 <p class="f-paragraph "> In the 1980s and early 1990s, software engineering
                     emphasized plan-driven, heavyweight methods involving detailed planning, documentation,<br>quality assurance, 
                     and formal design tools, which suited large, long-lived,
                    safety-critical systems like aerospace and government projects.<br> <br>
                    These projects required coordination among large, distributed teams and justified the overhead of rigorous
                    processes.<br>
                    However, when applied to <b>smaller business systems</b>, the bureaucracy became excessive, with more effort
                    spent on planning and documentation <br>than coding and testing. <br><br>
                    This inefficiency, coupled with the need to adapt to rapidly changing requirements, led to the rise of agile
                    methods in the 1990s. Agile approaches <br>shifted focus to incremental development, quick delivery of working software, customer
                    feedback, and minimal documentation, making them more <br>effective for dynamic application development.<br><br>
                    
                    The philosophy behind agile methods is reflected in the agile manifesto that was
                    agreed on by many of the leading developers of these methods.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="f-paragraph "> This manifesto states:<br><br>
                    
                    We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.<br>
                    Through this work we have come to value:<br><br></p>

                     left more.<br><br>
                    
                     Probably the best-known agile method is extreme programming (Beck, 1999;
                     Beck, 2000), which I describe later in this chapter. Other agile <br>approaches include
                     Scrum (Cohn, 2009; Schwaber, 2004; Schwaber and Beedle, 2001), Crystal
                     (Cockburn, 2001; Cockburn, 2004), Adaptive<br> Software Development (Highsmith,
                     2000), DSDM (Stapleton, 1997; Stapleton, 2003), and Feature Driven Development
                     (Palmer and Felsing, 2002). <br>The success of these methods has led to some integration
                     with more traditional development methods based on system modelling, resulting in
                     <br>the notion of agile modelling (Ambler and Jeffries, 2002) and agile instantiations of
                     the Rational Unified Process (Larman, 2002).<br><br>

                      Although these agile methods are all based around the notion of incremental devel
                    opment and delivery, they propose different processes to <br>achieve this. However, they
                    share a set of principles, based on the agile manifesto, and so have much in common.
                    These principles are shown <br>in Figure 3.1. Different agile methods instantiate these prin
                    ciples in different ways and I don’t have space to discuss all agile methods. Instead, <br>I
                    focus on two of the most widely used methods: extreme programming (Section 3.3) and
                    Scrum (Section 3.4).<br><br>
                
                    Agile methods have been very successful for some types of system development:<br><br></p>

                    <p class="s-paragraph"> As I discuss in the final section of this chapter, the success of agile methods has
                        meant that there is a lot of interest in using these methods for other types of software
                        development. However, because of their focus on small, tightly integrated teams,
                        there are problems in scaling them to large systems. There have also been experi
                        ments in using agile approaches for critical systems engineering (Drobna et al.,
                        2004). However, because of the need for security, safety, and dependability analysis
                        in critical systems, agile methods require significant modification before they can be
                        routinely used for critical systems engineering.<br><br>
                    
                     In practice, the principles underlying agile methods are sometimes difficult to
                     realize:</p>

                     <ol class="s-paragraph">
                        <li>Although the idea of customer involvement in the development process is an
                            attractive one, its success depends on having a customer who is willing and able
                            to spend time with the development team and who can represent all system
                            stakeholders. Frequently, the customer representatives are subject to other pres
                            sures and cannot take full part in the software development.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Individual team members may not have suitable personalities for the intense
                            involvement that is typical of agile methods, and therefore not interact well with
                            other team members.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Prioritizing changes can be extremely difficult, especially in systems for which
                            there are many stakeholders. Typically, each stakeholder gives different priori
                            ties to different changes.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Maintaining simplicity requires extra work. Under pressure from delivery
                            schedules, the team members may not have time to carry out desirable system
                            simplifications.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Many organizations, especially large companies, have spent years changing
                            their culture so that processes are defined and followed. It is difficult for them to
                            move to a working model in which processes are informal and defined by devel
                            opment teams.<br><br></li>
                     </ol>

                     <p class="s-paragraph">A key non-technical challenge with agile, incremental development arises when software is
                        built by an external supplier. Traditionally, contracts are based on a fixed set of requirements, 
                        but agile’s evolving specifications make this difficult. Instead, contracts usually pay for developmen
                        t time and effort, not for delivering predefined features. While this can benefit both parties if progress
                        is smooth, disputes may arise if problems occur, leading to disagreements over responsibility and costs.
                        Additionally, most agile literature focuses on new system development, while its use in software maintenance
                        and evolution is less documented, despite maintenance being a major part of software engineering.<br><br>
                        
                        There are two questions that should be considered when considering agile methods and maintenance:<br><br></p>

                        <ol class="s-paragraph">
                            <li> Are systems that are developed using an agile approach maintainable, given the emphasis in the development 
                                process of minimizing formal documentation?</li>
                            <li> Can agile methods be used effectively for evolving a system in response to customer change requests?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p class="s-paragraph" id="3.2">Agile methods often minimize formal documentation, arguing it quickly becomes outdated and unreliable. Instead,
                            they emphasize clean, well-structured, and continually improved code as the basis for maintainability. However,
                            the requirements document remains critical for system maintenance, as it explains what the system is meant to 
                            do and helps assess the impact of changes. Since many agile methods capture requirements informally and incrementally, 
                            they may lack a coherent, long-term record of requirements, which can pose challenges during system evolution.<br><br>
                            
                            Agile methods can make future system maintenance harder if requirements are poorly documented. However, applying agile
                            practices during maintenance—such as incremental delivery, designing for change, and keeping systems simple—can be highly
                            effective. In this sense, agile development itself can be seen as a form of continuous software evolution.<br><br>

                            After delivery, maintaining customer involvement becomes difficult, since customers are less likely to dedicate time to ongoing
                            maintenance. Mechanisms like formal change proposals may be needed to capture new requirements. Another challenge is team continuity:
                            agile relies heavily on shared, undocumented knowledge, so breaking up the team can result in significant knowledge loss.<br><br>

                            While advocates often promote agile enthusiastically and critics sometimes overstate its flaws, balanced views suggest that a
                            hybrid approach—combining agile practices with selected plan-driven techniques—may offer the most effective path forward.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="s-paragraph mt-10"> Agile approaches to software development consider design and implementation to be
                             the central activities in the software process. They incorporate other activities, such as
                            requirements elicitation and testing, into design and implementation. By contrast, a
                            plan-driven approach to software engineering identifies separate stages in the soft
                            ware process with outputs associated with each stage. The outputs from one stage are
                            used as a basis for planning the following process activity. Figure 3.2 shows the dis
                            tinctions between plan-driven and agile approaches to system specification.<br><br>
                                
                            In a plan-driven approach, iteration occurs within activities with formal docu
                            ments used to communicate between stages of the process. For example, the require
                            ments will evolve and, ultimately, a requirements specification will be produced.
                            This is then an input to the design and implementation process. In an agile approach,
                            iteration occurs across activities. Therefore, the requirements and the design are
                            developed together, rather than separately.<br><br>

                            and it may produce some design documentation. As I discuss in the following sec
                            tion, the agile development team may decide to include a documentation ‘spike’,
                            where, instead of producing a new version of a system, the team produce system
                            documentation.<br><br>
                            
                             In fact, most software projects include practices from plan-driven and agile
                              approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile approach,
                            you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational questions:<br><br></p>

                            <ol class="s-paragraph">
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to
                            implementation? If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> Is an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers
                            and get rapid feedback from them, realistic? If so, consider using agile methods.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> How large is the system that is being developed? Agile methods are most effec
                            tive when the system can be developed with a small co-located team who can
                            communicate informally. This may not be possible for large systems that require
                            larger development teams so a plan-driven approach may have to be used.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> What type of system is being developed? Systems that require a lot of analysis
                            before implementation (e.g., real-time system with complex timing require
                            ments) usually need a fairly detailed design to carry out this analysis. A plan
                            driven approach may be best in those circumstances.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph">What is the expected system lifetime? Long-lifetime systems may require more
                            design documentation to communicate the original intentions of the system  developers to the 
                            support team. However, supporters of agile methods rightly
                            argue that documentation is frequently not kept up to date and it is not of much
                            use for long-term system maintenance.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph">What technologies are available to support system development? Agile methods
                            often rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design. If you are develop
                            ing a system using an IDE that does not have good tools for program visualiza
                            tion and analysis, then more design documentation may be required.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> How is the development team organized? If the development team is distributed
                            or if part of the development is being outsourced, then you may need to develop
                            design documents to communicate across the development teams. You may
                            need to plan in advance what these are.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> Are there cultural issues that may affect the system development? Traditional
                            engineering organizations have a culture of plan-based development, as this is
                            the norm in engineering. This usually requires extensive design documentation,
                            rather than the informal knowledge used in agile processes.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph"> How good are the designers and programmers in the development team? It is
                            sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than plan-based
                            approaches in which programmers simply translate a detailed design into code.
                            If you have a team with relatively low skill levels, you may need to use the best
                            people to develop the design, with others responsible for programming.<br><br></li>
                            <li class="s-paragraph">Is the system subject to external regulation? If a system has to be approved by an
                            external regulator (e.g., the Federal Aviation Authority [FAA] approve software
                            that is critical to the operation of an aircraft) then you will probably be required
                            to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.<br><br></li>

                            <p class="s-paragraph" id="3.3"> In reality, the issue of whether a project can be labelled as plan-driven or agile is
                            not very important. Ultimately, the primary concern of buyers of a software system
                            is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and
                            does useful things for the individual user or the organization. In practice, many com
                            panies who claim to have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and

                            developed by pushing recognized good practice, such as iterative development, to
                            ‘extreme’ levels. For example, in XP, several new versions of a system may be devel

                            <p class="s-paragraph"> In extreme programming, requirements are expressed as scenarios (called user
                            stories), which are implemented directly as a series of tasks. Programmers work in
                            pairs and develop tests for each task before writing the code. All tests must be suc
                            cessfully executed when new code is integrated into the system. There is a short time
                            gap between releases of the system. Figure 3.3 illustrates the XP process to produce

                            <li> Incremental development is supported through small, frequent releases of the
                            system. Requirements are based on simple customer stories or scenarios that are

                           <li class="s-paragraph">Change is embraced through regular system releases to customers, test-first

                            The story cards are the main inputs to the XP planning process or the ‘planning
                            game’. Once the story cards have been developed, the development team breaks these
                            down into tasks (Figure 3.6) and estimates the effort and resources required for imple
                            menting each task. This usually involves discussions with the customer to refine the
                            requirements. The customer then prioritizes the stories for implementation, choosing
                            those stories that can be used immediately to deliver useful business support. The
                            intention is to identify useful functionality that can be implemented in about two
                            weeks, when the next release of the system is made available to the customer.<br><br>

                            Of course, as requirements change, the unimplemented stories change or may be
                            discarded. If changes are required for a system that has already been delivered, new
                            story cards are developed and again, the customer decides whether these changes
                            should have priority over new functionality.</p>

                            come to light and additional work is required to explore possible solutions. The team
                            may carry out some prototyping or trial development to understand the problem and
                            solution. In XP terms, this is a ‘spike’, an increment where no programming is done.
                            There may also be ‘spikes’ to design the system architecture or to develop system
                            documentation.<br><br>
                            Extreme programming takes an ‘extreme’ approach to incremental development.
                            New versions of the software may be built several times per day and releases are
                            delivered to customers roughly every two weeks. Release deadlines are never
                            slipped; if there are development problems, the customer is consulted and function
                            ality is removed from the planned release.<br><br>
                            When a programmer builds the system to create a new version, he or she must run
                            all existing automated tests as well as the tests for the new functionality. The new
                            build of the software is accepted only if all tests execute successfully. This then
                            becomes the basis for the next iteration of the system.<br><br>
                            A fundamental precept of traditional software engineering is that you should
                            design for change. That is, you should anticipate future changes to the software and
                            design it so that these changes can be easily implemented.<br><br> Extreme programming,
                            however, has discarded this principle on the basis that designing for change is often
                            wasted effort. It isn’t worth taking time to add generality to a program to cope with
                            change.<br><br> The changes anticipated often never materialize and completely different
                            change requests may actually be made. Therefore, the XP approach accepts that
                            changes will happen and reorganize the software when these changes actually occur.

                            with the result that code is often duplicated, parts of the software are reused in inap
                            propriate ways, and the overall structure degrades as code is added to the system.<br><br>
                            Extreme programming tackles this problem by suggesting that the software
                            should be constantly refactored. This means that the programming team look for
                            possible improvements to the software and implement them immediately. When a
                            team member sees code that can be improved, they make these improvements even
                            in situations where there is no immediate need for them. Examples of refactoring
                            include the reorganization of a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code, the tidy
                            ing up and renaming of attributes and methods, and the replacement of code with
                            calls to methods defined in a program library. Program development environments,
                            such as Eclipse (Carlson, 2005), include tools for refactoring which simplify the
                            process of finding dependencies between code sections and making global code
                            modifications.<br><br>
                            In principle then, the software should always be easy to understand and change as
                            new stories are implemented. In practice, this is not always the case. Sometimes
                            development pressure means that refactoring is delayed because the time is devoted
                            to the implementation of new functionality. Some new features and changes cannot
                            readily be accommodated by code-level refactoring and require the architecture of
                            the system to be modified.<br><br>
                            In practice, many companies that have adopted XP do not use all of the extreme
                            programming practices listed in Figure 3.4. They pick and choose according to their
                            local ways of working. For example, some companies find pair programming help
                            ful; others prefer to use individual programming and reviews. To accommodate dif
                            ferent levels of skill, some programmers don’t do refactoring in parts of the system
                            they did not develop, and conventional requirements may be used rather than user
                            stories. However, most companies who have adopted an XP variant use small
                            releases, test-first development, and continuous integration.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="s-paragraph">As I discussed in the introduction to this chapter, one of the important differences
                            between incremental development and plan-driven development is in the way that
                            the system is tested. With incremental development, there is no system specification
                            that can be used by an external testing team to develop system tests. As a conse
                            quence, some approaches to incremental development have a very informal testing
                            process, in comparison with plan-driven testing.<br><br>
                            To avoid some of the problems of testing and system validation, XP emphasizes
                            the importance of program testing. XP includes an approach to testing that reduces
                            the chances of introducing undiscovered errors into the current version of the system.<br><br>
                                               
                            The key features of testing in XP are:</p>

                            <ol class="s-paragraph">
                                <li> Test-first development</li>
                                <li> incremental test development from scenarios,</li>
                                <li> user involvement in the test development and validation, and</li>
                                <li> the use of automated testing frameworks.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p class="s-paragraph"> Test-first development is one of the most important innovations in XP. Instead of
                            writing some code and then writing tests for that code, you write the tests before you
                            write the code. This means that you can run the test as the code is being written and
                            discover problems during development.<br><br>
                            Writing tests implicitly defines both an interface and a specification of behavior
                            for the functionality being developed. Problems of requirements and interface misun
                            derstandings are reduced. This approach can be adopted in any process in which there
                            is a clear relationship between a system requirement and the code implementing that
                            requirement. In XP, you can always see this link because the story cards representing
                            the requirements are broken down into tasks and the tasks are the principal unit of
                            implementation. The adoption of test-first development in XP has led to more general
                            test-driven approaches to development (Astels, 2003). I discuss these in Chapter 8.
                            In test-first development, the task implementers have to thoroughly understand
                            the specification so that they can write tests for the system. This means that ambigu
                            ities and omissions in the specification have to be clarified before implementation
                            begins. Furthermore, it also avoids the problem of ‘test-lag’. This may happen when
                            the developer of the system works at a faster pace than the tester. The implementa
                            tion gets further and further ahead of the testing and there is a tendency to skip tests,
                            so that the development schedule can be maintained.<br><br>
                            User requirements in XP are expressed as scenarios or stories and the user priori
                            tizes these for development. The development team assesses each scenario and
                            breaks it down into tasks. For example, some of the task cards developed from the
                            story card for prescribing medication (Figure 3.5) are shown in Figure 3.6. Each task
                            generates one or more unit tests that check the implementation described in that task.
                            Figure 3.7 is a shortened description of a test case that has been developed to check
                            that the prescribed dose of a drug does not fall outside known safe limits.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="s-paragraph"> The role of the customer in the testing process is to help develop acceptance tests
                            for the stories that are to be implemented in the next release of the system. As I dis
                            cuss in Chapter 8, acceptance testing is the process where the system is tested using
                            customer data to check that it meets the customer’s real needs.<br><br>
                            Test-first development and automated testing usually results in a large number of
                            tests being written and executed. However, this approach does not necessarily lead to
                            thorough program testing. There are three reasons for this:</p>

                            <ol class="s-paragraph">
                            <li>Programmers prefer programming to testing and sometimes they take shortcuts
                            when writing tests. For example, they may write incomplete tests that do not
                            check for all possible exceptions that may occur.<br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>Some tests can be very difficult to write incrementally. For example, in a com
                            plex user interface, it is often difficult to write unit tests for the code that imple
                            ments the ‘display logic’ and workflow between screens.<br><br></li>
                            <li> It difficult to judge the completeness of a set of tests. Although you may have a
                            lot of system tests, your test set may not provide complete coverage. Crucial
                            parts of the system may not be executed and so remain untested.<br><br></li>
                            </ol>
                           <p class="s-paragraph"> Therefore, although a large set of frequently executed tests may give the impres
                            sion that the system is complete and correct, this may not be the case. If the tests are
                            not reviewed and further tests written after development, then undetected bugs may
                            be delivered in the system release.</p>

                            <p class="f-paragraph">The use of pair programming has a number of advantages:</p>
                            <ol class="s-paragraph">
                                <li>It supports the idea of collective ownership and responsibility for the system.
                                This reflects Weinberg’s (1971) idea of egoless programming where the soft
                                ware is owned by the team as a whole and individuals are not held responsible
                                for problems with the code. Instead, the team has collective responsibility for
                                resolving these problems.<br><br></li>
                                <li> It acts as an informal review process because each line of code is looked at by at
                                least two people. Code inspections and reviews (covered in Chapter 24) are very
                                successful in discovering a high percentage of software errors. However, they
                                are time consuming to organize and, typically, introduce delays into the devel
                                opment process. Although pair programming is a less formal process that prob
                                ably doesn’t find as many errors as code inspections, it is a much cheaper
                                inspection process than formal program inspections.<br><br></li>
                               <li> It helps support refactoring, which is a process of software improvement. The diffi
                               culty of implementing this in a normal development environment is that effort in
                               refactoring is expended for long-term benefit. An individual who practices refac
                               toring may be judged to be less efficient than one who simply carries on developing
                               code. Where pair programming and collective ownership are used, others benefit
                               immediately from the refactoring so they are likely to support the process.<br><br></li>

                            <p class="s-paragraph">Agile methods were developed for use by small programming teams who could
                            work together in the same room and communicate informally. Agile methods have
                            therefore been mostly used for the development of small and medium-sized systems.
                            Of course, the need for faster delivery of software, which is more suited to customer
                            needs, also applies to larger systems. Consequently, there has been a great deal of
                            interest in scaling agile methods to cope with larger systems, developed by large
                            organizations.<br><br>

                            Denning et al. (2008) argue that the only way to avoid common software engineer
                            ing problems, such as systems that don’t meet customer needs and budget overruns, is
                            to find ways of making agile methods work for large systems. Leffingwell (2007) dis

                                systems issues.</li><br>
                                <li class="s-paragraph"> Large systems are ‘brownfield systems’ (Hopkins and Jenkins, 2008); that is
                                they include and interact with a number of existing systems. Many of the system
                                requirements are concerned with this interaction and so don’t really lend them
                                selves to flexibility and incremental development. Political issues can also be
                                significant here—often the easiest solution to a problem is to change an existing
                                system. However, this requires negotiation with the managers of that system to
                                convince them that the changes can be implemented without risk to the system’s
                                operation.</li><br>
                                <li class="s-paragraph">Where several systems are integrated to create a system, a significant fraction of
                                the development is concerned with system configuration rather than original
                                code development. This is not necessarily compatible with incremental develop
                                ment and frequent system integration</li><br>
                                <li class="s-paragraph"> Large systems and their development processes are often constrained by exter
                                nal rules and regulations limiting the way that they can be developed, that
                                require certain types of system documentation to be produced, etc.</li><br>
                                <li class="s-paragraph"> Large systems have a long procurement and development time. It is difficult to
                                maintain coherent teams who know about the system over that period as,
                                inevitably, people move on to other jobs and projects.</li><br>
                                <li class="s-paragraph"> Large systems usually have a diverse set of stakeholders.<br> For example, nurses and
                                administrators may be the end-users of a medical system but senior medical staff,
                                hospital managers, etc. are also stakeholders in the system. It is practically impos
                                sible to involve all of these different stakeholders in the development process.</li>
