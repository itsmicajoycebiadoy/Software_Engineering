                        Why We Can't Run the Modern World Without Software?

                        National infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a
                        computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is
                        completely computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the
                        music industry, computer games, and film and television, is software intensive.
                        Therefore, software engineering is essential for the functioning of national and international societies.
                        Software systems are abstract and intangible. They are not constrained by the
                        properties of materials, governed by physical laws, or by manufacturing processes.
                        This simplifies software engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of
                        software. However, because of the lack of physical constraints, software systems can
                        quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.

                    Professional software development focuses on creating software for business, industrial, or commercial use — usually developed by teams rather than individuals. 
                    Unlike personal or hobbyist programming, professional software requires thorough documentation, maintenance, and configuration to ensure reliability and usability. 
                    Software engineering supports this process by providing structured methods for system design, specification, and evolution. 
                    Ultimately, professional software goes beyond writing code — it includes all necessary resources that make it functional, maintainable, and user-friendly.

            <p class = "ptext">Different types of systems require different development processes depending on their purpose and complexity. 
                For instance, real-time systems like aircraft software need full specification before development,

                science and systems engineering — computer science provides the theoretical foundations, while software 
                engineering focuses on practical application in building reliable systems. Systems engineering, on the other hand,

               1.3.1 An insulin Pump Control System
            </h3>
            </div>

            <p class = "ptext">
                An insulin pump is an embedded medical system that mimics the pancreas by automatically delivering insulin to regulate blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. 
                It collects data from a sensor, calculates the required insulin dose, and delivers it through a pump. 
                Traditional insulin injection methods are less precise, as they depend on manual measurements and timing. 
                Automated insulin systems improve safety by preventing dangerously high or low blood sugar levels and could 
                eventually be permanently integrated into patients' bodies.

            <p class = "ptext">
                Figure 1.4 shows the hardware components and organization of the insulin
                pump. To understand the examples in this book, all you need to know is that the
                blood sensor measures the electrical conductivity of the blood under different
                conditions and that these values can be related to the blood sugar level. The
                insulin pump delivers one unit of insulin in response to a single pulse from a controller. Therefore, to deliver 10 units of insulin, the controller sends 10 pulses to
                the pump. Figure 1.5 is a UML activity model that illustrates how the software
                transforms an input blood sugar level to a sequence of commands that drive the
                insulin pump.
            </p>

            <p class = "ptext">
                Clearly, this is a safety-critical system. If the pump fails to operate or does not
                operate correctly, then the user's health may be damaged or they may fall into a
                coma because their blood sugar levels are too high or too low. There are, therefore,
                two essential high-level requirements that this system must meet:

            </p>

            <ol class="oldesign">
                <li>
                The pump must be ready and able to deliver insulin whenever the user needs it.
                </li>
                <li>
                The pump must work reliably and give the right dose of insulin for the current blood sugar level.
                </li>
            </ol>

                The system must therefore be designed and implemented to ensure that the system always meets these requirements. More detailed requirements and discussions

            </div>

            <p class = "ptext">
                The MHC-PMS is a medical information system that manages records of patients with mental health conditions 
                and the treatments they receive. It uses a centralized database of patient data but can also run locally on 
                personal computers, allowing access even in clinics without secure network connectivity. When connected, the 
                system synchronizes with the main database, ensuring updated and accurate records across all locations.
            </p>

            <p class = "ptext">
                The system aims to improve healthcare efficiency and support decision-making in mental health services. 
                Its primary goals are to generate management information that helps health service managers evaluate 
                performance against set targets and to provide medical staff with timely information for patient treatment. 
                Users include doctors, nurses, and health visitors who deliver care, as well as receptionists, records staff, 
                and administrators who handle appointments, data management, and reporting.
            </p>

            <p class = "ptext">
                The system is used to record information about patients (name, address, age, next
                of kin, etc.), consultations (date, doctor seen, subjective impressions of the patient,
                etc.), conditions, and treatments. Reports are generated at regular intervals for medical staff and health authority managers. Typically, reports for medical staff focus on
                information about individual patients whereas management reports are anonymized
                and are concerned with conditions, costs of treatment, etc.
            </p>

            <p class = "ptext">
                The key features of the system are:

                Some mental illnesses cause patients to become suicidal or a danger to other

            <p class = "ptext">
                The overall design of the system has to take into account privacy and safety
                requirements. The system must be available when needed otherwise safety may be
                compromised and it may be impossible to prescribe the correct medication to patients.
                There is a potential conflict here—privacy is easiest to maintain when there is only a
                single copy of the system data. However, to ensure availability in the event of server
                failure or when disconnected from a network, multiple copies of the data should be
                maintained. I discuss the trade-offs between these requirements in later chapters.

                1.3.3 A Wilderness Weather Station
            </h3>
            </div>

            <p class = "ptext">
                To help monitor climate change and to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts in
                remote areas, the government of a country with large areas of wilderness decides to
                deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas. These weather stations collect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine,
                rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction.
            </p>
            <p class = "ptext">
                Wilderness weather stations are part of a larger system (Figure 1.7), which is a
                weather information system that collects data from weather stations and makes it
                available to other systems for processing. The systems in Figure 1.7 are:
            </p>

            <ol class="oldesign">

                    Responsible for collecting weather data, performing initial data processing, and transmitting it to the data management system.

                <li>
                    <span class="olbold">The Data Management and Archiving System:</span>
                    Collects data from all wilderness weather stations, processes and analyzes it, and archives it for retrieval by other systems, such as weather forecasting tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="olbold">The Station Maintenance System:</span>
                    Communicates via satellite with all wilderness weather stations to monitor system health, provide problem reports, update embedded software, and remotely control a station in case of issues.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class = "ptext">
                The weather station system is composed of multiple instruments that measure parameters like wind, temperature, pressure, and rainfall. Each instrument is controlled by software that periodically collects and manages data. Observations are taken frequently, with local processing and aggregation performed before transmitting data to the data management system. 
                If communication fails, the system stores the data locally until the connection is restored.
            </p>
             <p class = "ptext">
                Each weather station is battery-powered and must be entirely self-contained—there
                are no external power or network cables available. All communications are through a relatively slow-speed satellite link and the weather station must include some mechanism
                (solar or wind power) to charge its batteries. As they are deployed in wilderness areas,
                they are exposed to severe environmental conditions and may be damaged by animals.
                The station software is therefore not just concerned with data collection. It must also:

                    The system monitors instruments, power, and communication hardware, reporting any faults to the management system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="olbold">Power Management:</span>
                    It ensures batteries are charged when conditions allow and shuts down generators during potentially damaging weather.

                    <span class="olbold">Dynamic Reconfiguration:</span>
                    Parts of the software can be replaced with new versions, and backup instruments can be switched in when failures occur.

            </ol>
            <p class = "ptext">
                Because weather stations have to be self-contained and unattended, this means
                that the software installed is complex, even though the data collection functionality
                is fairly simple.
